# According to the OpenType Feature File specification section 2.e.iv,
# the following should be interpreted as vertical advance adjustment
# because -100 (a value record format A) appears within a ‘vkrn’ feature.
# However, the AFDKO makeotf tool v2.0.90 (built on Nov 19, 2015) still
# makes it a horizontal advance adjustment.  In our implementation,
# we follow the specification, so we produce different output than makeotf.
